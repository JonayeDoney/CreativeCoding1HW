When it comes to using computers, we have two main ways to interact with them: the Command-Line Interface (CLI) and the Graphical User Interface (GUI).
I’ve had experience with both, and each has its own strengths and challenges. A CLI is like talking directly to the computer and typing commands and instructions. 
It's efficient and powerful, especially when you need to do something quickly or automate tasks. For someone like me, who loves to solve problems with precision,
the CLI feels like a tool for real control. However, it requires you to know exactly what you're doing, and for beginners, it can be intimidating.
On the other hand,a GUI feels like navigating through a visual world, where you can point and click to do almost anything. For those who are new to computers, 
the GUI makes everything feel more intuitive. It’s like walking through a door and seeing a path laid out for you. But sometimes, when you need to do something faster or with more power, the GUI can feel slower or less direct. In the end, both have their place. A CLI might be for the tech-savvy, while the GUI is a comfortable starting point for everyone else.
